                        <p>Hi, I'm Connor Tait.  A data analyst and visualization enthusiast currently working in
                            federal consulting. I'm drawn to unearthing the stories behind the data, and using business
                            intelligence tools to bring them to life. In my
                            free time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, snowboarding, and following my favorite teams —
                            especially Chelsea FC and the Washington Commanders. Lately, I’ve also been diving into
                            creative hobbies like photography, videography, and playing guitar.</p>
