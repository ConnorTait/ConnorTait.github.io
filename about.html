                        <p>Hi, I'm Connor Tait. I'm a data analyst and visualization enthusiast currently working in
                            federal consulting. I love combining technical tools with creative storytelling. In my
                            free
                            time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, snowboarding, and following my favorite teams â€”
                            especially Chelsea FC and the Washington Commanders. Lately, Iâ€™ve also been diving into
                            creative hobbies like photography, videography, and guitar.</p>
