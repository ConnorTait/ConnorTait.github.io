          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Connor Tait. I'm a data analyst and visualization enthusiast currently working in federal consulting. I love combining technical tools with creative storytelling.  In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, snowboarding, and following my favorite teams — especially Chelsea FC and the Washington Commanders. Lately, I’ve also been diving into creative hobbies like photography, videography, and guitar.</p>
